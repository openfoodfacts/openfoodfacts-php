## Installation

With Composer:

```bash
composer require openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-php
```

## Usage
This is the most basic way of creating the API:
```php
$api = new OpenFoodFacts\Api('food','fr');
$product = $api->getProduct('3057640385148');
```
In the example above you access the "food" database, limited to the French language/country scope. 
The first parameter is either 
 - "food"
 - "beauty" or 
 - "pet"
 
to decide which product database you want to use.

The second parameter decides the language/country scope of the chosen database: f.e. "world" or "de" or "fr". 

For more details on this topic: see the [API Documentation](https://en.wiki.openfoodfacts.org/API/Read#Countries_and_Language_of_the_Response)

These are all the parameters you really need for basic usage.

As return types for ```$api->getProduct``` you get an ```Document::class``` Object. 
This may also be an Object of Type  ```FoodProduct::class```,```PetProduct::class```, ```BeautyProduct::class``` depending on which API you are creating.
These objects inherit from the more generic ```Document::class```

In the example above, we use the 'food' API and there will get a ```FoodProduct::class```

For getting a first overview the ```Document::class``` has a function to return an array representation(sorted) for a first start. 
```php
$product = $api->getProduct('3057640385148');
$productDataAsArray = $product->getData();
```


#### Optional Parameters
The other parameters are optional and for a more sophisticated use of the api (from a software development point of view):

An example in code is found here: [cached_example.php](examples/01-basic_api_usage/cached_example.php)
